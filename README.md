# Parkinson’s Disease Detection 🧠🧪

## What is Parkinson’s Disease?

Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that affects movement.  
It happens when brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. This causes symptoms like:
- Shaking
- Stiffness
- Slowness of movement
- Trouble with balance and walking

While it currently can't be cured, medications can help manage the symptoms.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.  
It works by:
- Drawing a line (or boundary) to separate different groups of data.
- Finding the **best** possible boundary that separates categories clearly.

SVM is highly effective when:
- The dataset has clear margins of separation.
- Tasks involve classification, such as facial recognition or email spam detection.
